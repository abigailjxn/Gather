# Gather

## Problem
Have you ever had trouble harmoneously organizing a gathering of friends?  Gather is a party planning app to help friends coordinate an event?

## How to Use

A party host first completes a survey with details of the gathering.  The survey includes information about the gathering including location, time, type of gathering, and attire.  The host is also able to share other details of the gathering, such as if there are any known food allergies or is the gathering is to be a suprise.  

Once the survey is completed, an event page is generated.  All information the host provided is shown on the event page to help coordinate the gathering.  Event coordinated harmoneously!
